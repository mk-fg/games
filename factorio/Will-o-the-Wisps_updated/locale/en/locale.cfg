Will-o-the-Wisps_updated=A glowing enigmatic life form was found to inhabit alien forests at night.\nBased on the original mod by Betep3akata. (This mod may cause desyncs in multiplayer mode!)

[item-description]
wisp-purple=Will-o'-wisp in the state of a spore. These wisps cause corrosion of structures around them and have a devastating effect on power infrastructure.
wisp-yellow=They live in forests and aren't generally aggressive.
wisp-red=They live under stones. Physical damage initiates a fast replication process!
wisp-green=Fast harmless will-o'-the-wisps that are smaller and more curious than others.
UV-lamp=Reduces the lifetime of purple will-o'-the-wisps at night, and scares off other wisps.\n(Radius: 12 tiles)
wisp-detector=Reports counts of wisps within the detection range, which can be controlled by setting signal R.\n(Default: 16 tiles; maximum: 128 tiles)
wisp-drone-blue=Pet UV-resistant wisps with an especially bright glow and a long lifespan, but an extremely underwhelming attack.
wisp-drone-blue-capsule=Pet UV-resistant wisp with an especially bright glow and a long lifespan, but an extremely underwhelming attack to use as a personal lantern.

[mod-setting-description]
wisps-can-attack=When disabled, will-o'-wisps will never attack, even if killed. Wisp spores will still corrode stuff around them when passing by, though.
wisp-death-retaliation-radius=Radius around killed wisp in which wisps retaliate against aggression. Setting it to 0 will mean "the whole map"!
defences-shoot-wisps=When disabled, only hostile wisps will be targeted by defences like turrets or a player. They can still  be force-targeted manually (activate with __CONTROL__shoot-selected__), attacked by explosives or smashed by vehicles, though; this will aggro them!
purple-wisp-damage=When disabled, purple will-o'-the-wisps will drift by harmlessly without causing any damage to nearby structures.
wisp-aggression-factor=Chance in the range 0-1.0 that some wisps on the map can randomly become aggressive, checked roughly every game minute.\n(0: never)
wisp-biter-aggression=Wisps fight native enemies (e.g. biters)
wisp-aggro-on-player-only=Changes wisps in surrounding area to not become angry if something not directly linked to the player kills them. Can be useful with various "environmental hazard" mods which damage/kill entities on the map randomly.

wisp-map-spawn-count=Limits he total number of active wisps present on the map. Lower values can be used for better game performance!
wisp-map-spawn-pollution-factor=Wisps appear in forested places at night according to the formula "1 + factor * relative-pollution", where relative-pollution is 0 for unpolluted areas and 1.0 for the most polluted areas.\nExample: Setting this factor to 5 will make wisps appear in most polluted areas 6x as likely ("1 + 5*1"), 0 will make chances equal, and a factor of -0.9 will have them spawn largely away from pollution ("1 - 0.9 * 1 = 0.1", so they are 10x less likely to spawn on the most polluted tile(s) than on non-polluted ones).

wisp-map-spawn-purple=Chance of spawning purple will-o'-wisps in random forests at night. Must be in the range 0-1.0.\nThe sum of the chances for all wisp types may also be less than 1 (wisps spawn less in general) or greater than 1 (values will be used as weights then, i.e. p=y=r=1 is the same as p=y=r=0.33).
wisp-map-spawn-yellow=Chance of spawning yellow will-o'-wisps in random forests at night. Must be in the range 0-1.0.\nThe sum of the chances for all wisp types may also be less than 1 (wisps spawn less in general) or greater than 1 (values will be used as weights then, i.e. p=y=r=1 is the same as p=y=r=0.33).
wisp-map-spawn-red=Chance of spawning red will-o'-wisps in random forests at night. Must be in the range 0-1.0.\nThe sum of the chances for all wisp types may also be less than 1 (wisps spawn less in general) or greater than 1 (values will be used as weights then, i.e. p=y=r=1 is the same as p=y=r=0.33).
wisp-map-spawn-green=Chance of spawning green will-o'-wisps in random forests at night. Must be in the range 0-1.0.\nThe sum of the chances for all wisp types may also be less than 1 (wisps spawn less in general) or greater than 1 (values will be used as weights then, i.e. p=y=r=1 is the same as p=y=r=0.33).
