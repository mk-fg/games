[item-description]
wisp-purple=Will-o'-wisp in the state of a spore. These wisps cause corrosion of structures around them and can damage power infrastructure in particular.
wisp-yellow=Live in forests and aren't generally aggressive.
wisp-red=They live under rocks. Physical damage can lead to a fast replication process.
wisp-green=Fast harmless will-o'-the-wisps that are smaller and more curious than others.
UV-lamp=Reduces lifetime of purple will-o'-the-wisps at night, and scares off other wisps.\n(Radius: 12 tiles)
wisp-detector=Reports counts of wisps within the detection range.\nRange can be set by R signal (default = 16 tiles, 128 tiles max).
wisp-drone-blue=Pet UV-resistant wisps with an especially bright glow and a long lifespan, but extremely underwhelming attack.
wisp-drone-blue-capsule=Pet UV-resistant wisp with an especially bright glow and a long lifespan, but extremely underwhelming attack to use as a personal lantern.

[mod-setting-description]
wisps-can-attack=When disabled, will-o'-wisps will never attack, even if killed. Wisp spores will still corrode stuff around them when passing by though.
wisp-death-retaliation-radius=Radius around killed wisp in which wisps retaliate against aggression. Setting it to 0 will mean "the whole map"!
defences-shoot-wisps=When disabled, only hostile wisps will be targeted by defences like turrets or a player. They can still  be force-targeted manually (activate with __CONTROL__shoot-selected__), attacked by explosives or smashed by vehicles though, which can still make them angry.
purple-wisp-damage=When disabled, purple will-o'-the-wisps will drift by harmlessly without causing any damage to nearby structures.
wisp-aggression-factor=Chance in the range 0-1.0 that some wisps on the map can randomly become aggressive, checked roughly every game minute (0 - never).
wisp-biter-aggression=Whether will-o-wisps attack biters and vice-versa.\nWarning: can have unforseen consequences when biters stumble upon red wisps!
wisp-aggro-on-player-only=Changes wisps in surrounding area to not become angry if something not directly linked to player kills them. Can be useful with various "environmental hazard" mods which damage/kill entities on the map randomly.
wisp-red-replication-factor=Chance in 0-1.0 range, that is rolled sometimes when red wisps take damage to trigger their replication.\nHigher-impact weapons and ammo counteract effect of this significantly.
wisp-red-replication-tbf=Token-bucket rate limiting parameters in "rate[:burst]" format, where "rate" (in ticks) can also be expressed as A/B ratio.\nFor example, "1/60:30" value will be parsed as one replication per 60 ticks, with up to 30 build up over time. Value for burst parameter is 1 (use rate for a strict delay), if omitted.

wisp-map-spawn-count=Limits the total number of active wisps present on the map.\nLower values can be used for better game performance.
wisp-map-spawn-pollution-factor=Wisps appear in forested places at night according to the formula "1 + factor * relative-pollution", where relative-pollution is 0 for unpolluted areas and 1.0 for the most polluted areas.\nExample: Setting this factor to 5 will make wisps appear in most polluted areas 6x as likely ("1 + 5*1"), 0 will make chances equal, and a factor of -0.9 will have them spawn largely away from pollution ("1 - 0.9 * 1 = 0.1", so they are 10x less likely to spawn on the most polluted chunks than on non-polluted ones).

wisp-map-spawn-purple=Chance of spawning purple will-o'-wisps in random forests at night. Must be in 0-1.0 range.\nSum of the chances for all wisp types can be:\n- Less than 1, in which case wisps spawn less in general\n- Greater than 1 - values will be used as weights, i.e. p=y=r=1 is the same as p=y=r=0.33.
wisp-map-spawn-yellow=Chance of spawning yellow will-o'-wisps in random forests at night. Must be in 0-1.0 range.\nSum of the chances for all wisp types can be:\n- Less than 1, in which case wisps spawn less in general\n- Greater than 1 - values will be used as weights, i.e. p=y=r=1 is the same as p=y=r=0.33.
wisp-map-spawn-red=Chance of spawning red will-o'-wisps in random forests at night. Must be in the range 0-1.0.\nSum of the chances for all wisp types can be:\n- Less than 1, in which case wisps spawn less in general\n- Greater than 1 - values will be used as weights, i.e. p=y=r=1 is the same as p=y=r=0.33.
wisp-map-spawn-green=Chance of spawning green will-o'-wisps in random forests at night. Must be in 0-1.0 range.\nSum of the chances for all wisp types can be:\n- Less than 1, in which case wisps spawn less in general\n- Greater than 1 - values will be used as weights, i.e. p=y=r=1 is the same as p=y=r=0.33.
